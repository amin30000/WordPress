== Changelog ==

= 1.4.1 =
* Fixed a WP 5.9 compatibility issue that made it impossible to drag and drop items.

* Added a "Copy visibility" button. It copies Toolbar item visibility from one role to another.

* Fixed a few jQuery deprecation warnings.
* Tested up to WP 5.6.1.

= 1.3.4 =
* Fixed the "Customize" item not appearing in the top level of the Toolbar. If you have already edited the Toolbar before installing this update, "Customize" won't show up automatically. Instead, you can find it in the "Your Site Name" -> "appearance" group.
